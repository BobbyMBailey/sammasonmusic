# Sam Mason Music
Source Code for [sammasonmusic.com](https://www.sammasonmusic.com)

## Visual Design
The site follows [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) and in a few places directly leverages [Material Design Web Components](https://material.io/develop/web/)

A light StyleGuide is found at [sammasonmusic styleguide](https://www.sammasonmusic.com/styleguide) 

## Reports
Performance, SEO, and Best Practices metrics and analysis are generated by running `yarn audit` or using [Lighthouse Chrome Dev Tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)


# Development
Site content is located under `src` 

Other files are for verification, auditing, and build tooling

## Local

# install dependencies
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev
```

## Publish Changes
1). Generate static project to push to the site
``` bash
$ yarn generate
```
2). Upload the contents of `.dist`
